# Cryptjournal

Lightweight Android journal app with entry encryption and biometric
authentication.

## Motivation

I keep a journal in gpg-encrypted text files. All entries are consistently
formatted, which is maintained by my vim script. As a consequence, these
entries can be comfortably accessed only from my linux machines. I have
sometimes felt the urge to write some thoughts when in the subway or when
having a tiny amount of time to spare between daily activities and couldn't,
because of the limitations of my system. This project is focused on removing
these constraints.
